# MaterialKit

Welcome to MaterialKit for iOS. MaterialKit is not just another components library. We built everything using an underlying graphics and animation framework to ensure extensibility and to fuel everyone's imagination.

### Examples

Checkout an ever growing catalog of example code, and soon enough, we are opening to the community to share and explore what others are doing with MaterialKit.

### CocoaPods Support

MaterialKit is on CocoaPods under the name [MK](https://cocoapods.org/?q=MK).

### NavigationBarView

One of Material Design's greatest additions to UI is the NavigationBarView. In the Examples folder, you can checkout some code to get you started with this wonderful component.

### CardView

Right out of the box to a fully customized configuration, CardView always stands out. Take a look at a few examples in action and find more in the Examples directory.

Easily remove the pulse animation and add a background image for an entirely new feel.

Adjust the alignment of the UI elements to create different configurations of the CardView.

CardViews are so flexible they create entirely new components by removing all but certain elements. For example, bellow is a button bar by only setting the button values of the CardView.

### ImageCardView

Bold and attractive, ImageCardView is the next step from a CardView. In the Examples folder you will find examples using the ImageCardView. Below are some animations to give you an idea of the possibilities the ImageCardView has to offer.
